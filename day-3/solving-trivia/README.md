## Objectives

1. Use Objective-C to solve a trivia problem.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab.

Open the `solving-trivia.xcworkspace` file.  
**Note:** *This is the workspace since this lab includes a test.*

Write your solution in the `solveTrivia` method provided on `FISAppDelegate`. It should return an `NSString` that contains the answer to this trivia question:

**What is the only state whose capital contains none of the characters as the state name?**  
Example: Alaska isn't the answer because Juneau and Alaska both contain an A.

##### Hints:
*Is there a way to split a string into characters?*  
*Does your comparison need to be case insensitive?*
